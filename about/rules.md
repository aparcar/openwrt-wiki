# OpenWrt/LEDE Project Rules

1.  The only role distinction within the _OpenWrt_ (former _LEDE_) project is
    between committers and non-committers, there is no core developer group or
    other specially privileged members.
2.  All committers have the right to vote and are invited to liberally exercise
    this voting right in order to keep a broad consensus on project matters.
3.  Project matters, overall development directions etc. are decided by simple
    majority votes. Votes may be held in different ways like simple yes/no
    decisions, majority decisions among multiple proposed choices etc.
4.  Committers being unreachable for three months in a row shall get their
    commit and voting rights revoked in order to retain the ability to do
    majority votes among the remaining active committers.
5.  There shall be only full commit rights in any case, no partial access or
    otherwise restricted access to the repositories.
6.  Frequent contributors may become committers after a simple majority
    agreement among existing committers. Project members are free to suggest
    suitable people.
7.  Any votes and decisions made will be made public on the project websites.
8.  Project infrastructure should be outsourced FOSS community operated
    services whenever possible in order to allow project members to focus on
    actual development efforts.
9.  Any infrastructure that cannot be outsourced and/or is operated by the
    project itself shall be administrable by at least three different people to
    reduce the likelyhood of the project getting locked out due to operators
    being unreachable. Responsible operators for the various services shall be
    documented publicly.
10. The project will not offer email accounts under its project domain for
    privacy and equality reasons.
11. Changes to these rules require a two third majority among the committers
    holding voting rights and shall be documented.
12. Be nice to each other.
