# Welcome to the OpenWrt Project

The OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded
devices. Instead of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt
provides a fully writable filesystem with package management. This frees
you from the application selection and configuration provided by the
vendor and allows you to customize the device through the use of
packages to suit any application. For developers, OpenWrt is the
framework to build an application without having to build a complete
firmware around it; for users this means the ability for full
customization, to use the device in ways never envisioned.

See the [Table of Hardware](toh:start) for supported devices.
For more information about OpenWrt project organization, see the [About
OpenWrt](:about) pages.

## Current stable series: OpenWrt 19.07

### Old stable series: OpenWrt 18.06

## Why use OpenWrt?

People install OpenWrt because they believe it works better than the
stock firmware from their vendor. They find it is more stable, offers
more features, is more secure and has better support.

* **Extensibility:** OpenWrt provides many capabilities found only in high-end devices. Its 3000+ application packages are standardized, so you can easily replicate the same setup on any supported device, including two (or even five) year old routers.

* **Security:** OpenWrt's standard installation is secure by default, with Wi-Fi disabled, no poor passwords or backdoors. OpenWrt's software components are kept up-to-date, so vulnerabilities get closed shortly after they are discovered. [More...](reasons_to_use_openwrt#security)

* **Performance and Stability:** OpenWrt firmware is made of standardized modules used in all supported devices. This means each module will likely receive more testing and bug fixing than stock firmware which can be tweaked for each product line and never touched again. [More...](reasons_to_use_openwrt#performance_stability)

* **Strong Community Support:** OpenWrt team members are regular participants on the [OpenWrt Forum](https://forum.openwrt.org), [OpenWrt Developer](https://lists.openwrt.org/mailman/listinfo/openwrt-devel) and [OpenWrt Admin](https://lists.openwrt.org/mailman/listinfo/openwrt-adm) mailing lists, and [LEDE's IRC channels.](:contact#irc_channels) You can interact directly with developers, volunteers managing the software modules and with other long-time OpenWrt users, drastically increasing the chances you will solve the issue at hand.

 * **Research:** Many teams use OpenWrt as a platform for their research into network performance. This means that the improvements of their successful experiments will be available in OpenWrt first, well before it gets incorporated into mainline, vendor firmware. [More...](reasons_to_use_openwrt#research_platform)

* **Open Source/No additional cost:** OpenWrt is provided without any monetary cost. It has been entirely created by a team of volunteers: developers and maintainers, individuals and companies. If you enjoy using OpenWrt, consider contributing some effort to [help us improve it for others!](#openwrt_wants_you) All of the above is possible because OpenWrt is part of the Open Source community, and powered by Linux kernel.

## Announcing the OpenWrt/LEDE merge

## OpenWrt wants you!

Like any open source project, OpenWrt thrives on the efforts of its users and
developers.

* If you want to develop the software, please refer to our [Developer Guide](docs:guide-developer:source-code:start) to learn how to get the source code, build it, and contribute your changes back to the project.

* If you're not a developer, you can still help. The documentation can always be improved (even if it's to verify that the instructions match your experience), or you can help other community members with questions. Donâ€™t hesitate to [Register yourself in the wiki](:register_yourself_in_the_wiki), or join our [mailing list](https://lists.openwrt.org/mailman/listinfo/openwrt-devel) and [IRC channels](:contact#irc_channels) to get in touch.
